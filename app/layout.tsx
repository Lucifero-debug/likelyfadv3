/* One face for every heading — display type, wordmarks and card titles alike.
   Montserrat has a large x-height, so it holds at small sizes too and there is
   no second heading token to keep in sync.

   NO 600. Exactly one class string in the repo asked for it (the parked v1 FAQ
   title) and a 600 request with no 600 face resolves up to 700, which is the
   same accommodation Roboto's note below already describes. Listing it bought a
   fourth @font-face rule for a weight nothing renders.

   AND LISTING A WEIGHT COSTS NO BYTES, WHICH IS THE THING TO KNOW BEFORE
   TOUCHING THESE ARRAYS AGAIN. next/font resolves all three of these families
   to their VARIABLE file — every weight below emits its own @font-face rule,
   and every one of those rules points at the same single woff2 covering the
   whole 100-900 axis. Trimming the arrays makes the declaration honest; it does
   not make the page lighter, and adding a weight back would not make it
   heavier. The 104KB of font this page preloads is three files, one per family,
   and it is three files whether these arrays name two weights or nine.

   WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY MOVE THAT NUMBER is dropping a FAMILY, or dropping a
   family's preload — and neither is free here: all three are used above the
   fold (JetBrains in the hero kicker and the reassurance line), so an
   unpreloaded one swaps in visibly on first paint. */

        {/* WARM THE MEDIA ORIGIN BEFORE ANYTHING ASKS IT FOR A BYTE.

            Every poster and every clip on this page lives on the blob store, not
            on this origin — so the first tile's request begins with a DNS
            lookup, a TCP handshake and a TLS negotiation that nothing has
            started yet, and none of it can begin until the parser has reached a
            <video> most of the way down the body. On a phone that is a couple of
            hundred milliseconds of nothing in front of the FIRST poster, and the
            hero wall is the first thing anybody looks at.

            preconnect does the whole handshake now, from the head, in parallel
            with the rest of the document. crossOrigin is REQUIRED and not
            optional decoration: media and images are fetched in CORS mode, and a
            preconnect opened without it warms a connection in the wrong
            credentials mode that the real request then cannot reuse — the
            handshake gets paid twice and the hint is worse than nothing.

            dns-prefetch sits behind it for the browsers that ignore preconnect
            hints under connection pressure; it is a few bytes and resolves the
            name at least.

            NO rel="preload" FOR INDIVIDUAL POSTERS. The wall picks its clips
            through a round-robin deal at module scope, so which poster is on
            screen first is not knowable here, and a preload naming the wrong
            file spends the budget it was meant to save.

            BOTH ARE SKIPPED WHEN THERE IS NO THIRD PARTY TO WARM. In
            development the library is served from the local /videos cache, so
            MEDIA_ORIGIN is the empty string — and `<link rel="preconnect"
            href="">` resolves against the document, which asks the browser to
            warm a connection to itself. Harmless, but it is a hint that can
            only ever be wrong, so it is not emitted.

            A TERNARY RETURNING null, NOT `&&`, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS A CRASH.
            MEDIA_ORIGIN is the empty STRING in development, and `{"" && …}`
            evaluates to `""` — which React renders as a text node. A text node
            is not legal in <head>, so the obvious form of this guard hydrates
            with "whitespace text nodes cannot be a child of <head>" and takes
            the whole page's hydration down with it. `&&` is only safe to guard
            with when the left side is a real boolean. */}
