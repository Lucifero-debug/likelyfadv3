/* ============================================================================
   THE ONE VIDEO TILE. Every autoplaying clip on the page is this component, so
   the loading policy is written once instead of three times with three
   different answers.

   IT IS A WRAPPER OVER lib/useInViewPlay, NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR IT. That file
   already owns the hard part — ONE IntersectionObserver for every tile on the
   page rather than one each, a per-lane cap on how many play at once, a dwell
   so tiles you scroll PAST never fetch at all, a pause for the length of a
   scroll gesture, and a stagger between starts so twenty streams do not split
   the connection twenty ways. All of that is load-bearing and profiled; the
   notes there have the measurements. This component supplies the markup and
   the second half of the policy — WHEN THE BYTES ARE ALLOWED TO BE ASKED FOR —
   and hands playback to the registry.

   WHAT IT REPLACED. The three video sections had three policies. The hero wall
   was on the registry with preload="none" and behaved correctly: 10 of its 32
   tiles playing at rest. The work wall had opted out entirely — `autoPlay`,
   preload="auto", one play() on mount and no observer — so all 96 of its tiles
   were playing and fully buffered while sitting below the fold. Measured on a
   1920x1080 load with nothing scrolled, that was 60 distinct clips and 18MB of
   video before the visitor had moved. Testimonials was already correct, because
   it creates no media element until a card is hovered or opened.

   TWO GATES, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME GATE.

     ATTACH — this file. `src` is withheld from the element until it comes
     within ATTACH_MARGIN of the viewport. preload="none" alone already stops
     the fetch, so this is belt to that braces: it also stops the element being
     a media resource at all, and it makes the intent legible in the DOM rather
     than resting on a preload value being honoured.

     PLAY — useInViewPlay. Threshold, dwell, lane budget, stagger. Fires later
     and more conservatively than attach, which is the whole point of the
     200px: the bytes are on their way by the time a tile is eligible to start,
     so play() is a resume rather than a cold fetch.

   AND THE LEAD ONLY EXISTS IF THE PRELOAD IS PROMOTED WITH THE SOURCE. This
   was the hole. `preload="none"` is not "fetch lazily", it is "fetch NOTHING
   until something calls play()", and it is an attribute the element keeps for
   life. Setting `src` under it therefore moved no bytes at all: the 200px lead
   named a file and then sat on it, and every tile still opened its connection
   cold at the instant it was allowed to start — DNS was warm by then but the
   request, the container parse and the first media chunk were all still ahead
   of the first frame. The tile held its poster across the whole of that, which
   is the beat of dead poster you see as a clip enters a lane.

   So the attach step now promotes the element to LEAD_PRELOAD in the same
   breath as the source. It is deliberately "metadata" rather than "auto": the
   expensive half of a cold start is the connection and the moov, and metadata
   buys both without committing to the whole file for tiles the lane budget may
   never give a slot to. It is also why the promotion lives HERE and not in the
   JSX — a preload on the element at first paint is a request during load for
   every tile on the page, which is the policy this component was written to
   replace. Gated behind attach it is only ever the near-viewport handful.

   THE ATTACH OBSERVER IS SHARED, for the same reason the registry's is. One
   observer watching N targets is one callback; N observers watching one target
   each is N callbacks, all of them firing inside a continuously animating
   transform. The walls mount 128 elements between them.
