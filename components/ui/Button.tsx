   700, not 600: Roboto has no 600, so the browser resolves it up to 700 anyway.

/* WIDTH ONLY — the border COLOUR belongs to the variant, and every variant must
   name one. `border-transparent` used to live here, and it silently beat the
   variants: Tailwind emits `.border-transparent` after `.border-ink` and
   `.border-line`, all three are single-class selectors of equal specificity, so
   the last one written to the stylesheet wins no matter what order the classes
   sit in on the element. The outlined variants were rendering with an invisible
   border because of it. One border-color utility per button, no exceptions. */

   the caller wrote them in.

   `compact` is the nav CTA on a phone — next to a 40px wordmark a full-size
   button is the loudest thing on the bar. It reverts at the tablet breakpoint,
   the same one where the nav links come back, so the bar changes shape exactly
   once. Both steps clear the 44px minimum: 0.875rem of Roboto on a 1.6
   line-height is 22.4px, so py-3 puts the compact button at ~46px.

   `min-h-[44px]` STATES that floor instead of leaving it to arithmetic. The
   height above is DERIVED from the body leading, so an edit to that leading
   resizes this button with nothing in this file touched: taking the page to
   1.2 once put the compact CTA at 43px, under the floor, silently. */

      IT EXISTS BECAUSE `target="_blank"` USED TO BE WELDED TO `contact`, and

      link on the page. The work wall's Drive library is the second, and
      spelling its target inline at the call site would have meant spelling the
      rel there too — which is the half everyone forgets. A page opened with

      navigate the tab it came from, so the two belong together in one place
      rather than in one place and one caller.
