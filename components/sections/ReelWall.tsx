/* Wall of autoplaying portrait reels, sitting beside the hero on a laptop and
   below it on a phone.

     lap and up → three vertical columns, all travelling the SAME way
     below lap  → three horizontal rows, all travelling the SAME way

   ONE set of markup for both. The lane's flex direction and the animation flip
   at the breakpoint; nothing is rendered twice and no clip is fetched twice.

   NOTHING HERE IS 3D. Every card faces the viewer square on — no rotateY, no
   translateZ, no perspective. The only depth cue is that the outer lanes rest
   a hair smaller than the middle one (0.94 against 0.97); flatten those three
   numbers to one value if you want the columns strictly identical.

   Each lane renders its clips TWICE and slides by exactly half its own length,
   which is why the loop is seamless with no JS driving it.

   THE LANES ALL RUN ONE WAY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DIRECTION RULE. The middle
   one used to carry `animation-direction: reverse` so the wall read down · up ·
   down. Counter-running lanes are the classic marquee move and they are the
   reason this wall never settled: two neighbouring clips travelling opposite
   ways put a shear line between them, the eye is handed two things to track
   instead of one, and the wall competes with the hero it sits beside rather
   than sitting behind it. One direction turns three lanes into one drift.

   NOTHING REPLACES REVERSE, because the thing it was really buying is already
   here: the three DURATIONS are 78, 96 and 86 seconds, none a multiple of
   another, so the lanes drift apart and never lock into step. That was always
   the job of the durations — reverse was only making the desynchrony loud. */

/* Deal the wall's window of the library out across lanes. takeReels spreads
   clips from the same shoot far apart, so three near-identical doctor spots
   never land in one lane. The work wall's window starts where this one ends,
   so nothing appears twice on the page.

   Hoisted out of the component because it is pure over module constants. It
   used to run per render, so the whole union-find-and-sort in reelOrder re-ran
   on every pause toggle and every lightbox open and close. */

   Transform and opacity only in the transition. box-shadow was in here once
   and is the one property that can never be: it repaints a 60px blur every
   frame, around a card the marquee is translating and a video is decoding
   into. The pink hover shadow is therefore a second layer cross-faded over the
