   NO min-height, and this is the one place this build deviates from v1 on
   purpose. v1 sets `min-height: 90svh` here, which on a phone is the entire gap
   between the hero and the reel wall: the content runs ~325px, so centring it
   inside a 760px box parks ~157px of dead air under the reassurance line before
   the 24px of padding even starts. Without it the hero is content height and
   the seam to the wall is just 24px + the wall's own 24px, which also lets the
   reels peek into the first screen. Add `min-h-[70svh]` back here if you want
   some of that height returned — every px of it lands under the copy. */

/* OPTICAL ALIGNMENT for the split hero's wrapped headline line.

   Every line of the headline starts at the same x — the boxes are flush. The
   INK is not, because letters carry different left side bearings: the capital A
   that opens line 1 is a triangle whose stroke runs to the edge of its glyph
   box, while the lowercase a that opens line 2 is round and sits inset. So line
   2 reads as indented even though nothing is indenting it.

   The negative margin moves the WHOLE block left; the text-indent puts the
   FIRST line back. Net effect: line 1 does not move at all, so the headline
   still lines up with the kicker and the subline, and every wrapped line after
   it shifts left by the bearing difference. If the headline ever sets on one
   line the two cancel exactly, so there is nothing to undo at other widths.

   A TASTE knob, not a measurement — nudge it until the two lines look flush at
   your window width, and set it to 0 to switch the correction off. Laptop only:
   below the split the hero is centred, where none of it applies. */

          NO `gap` ON THIS COLUMN. Every gap in it is the `mt-*` of the child
          below, because the four gaps are four different relationships and one
          gap cannot tell them apart: 8 under the kicker, which belongs to the

          the heading block and into the action; 16 under the buttons, because
          the reassurance belongs to them. A `gap` sums with each margin and

          the same 20. */}

            deliberately tight, stacked-block setting — and the lines were
            opened up to here. The headline is the only place that tight a
            setting ever read as deliberate rather than cramped, so if it goes
            back down, keep the change scoped to this h1 and off SectionHeading.
