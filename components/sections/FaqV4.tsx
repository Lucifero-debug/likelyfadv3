/* FAQ — V4. The centred, hairline-ruled reference, in the same language as
   WhyUsV4 and TestimonialsV4: Bricolage-weight extrabold headings, a 12px mono
   kicker, a 1280 page at a 56 gutter. The desktop values:

     SECTION   1280 cap · 56 gutter · 64 top and bottom
     HEADER    672 measure · CENTRED · 10 kicker → heading · 40 → list
     KICKER    12px mono, uppercase, 0.1em tracked · centred · NO BAR
     HEADING   48px EXTRABOLD, centred, leading 1.088

     ROW       24 top and bottom · question and marker pushed apart

   WHAT SEPARATES V4 FROM FaqV2 AND FaqV3:

     1. THERE IS NO BOX. V2 gives every question a 24-radius pill and V3 gives
        it a square bordered card; this draws one hairline under each row and
        one above the first, and nothing else. The list is a ruled table, not a
        stack of objects — which is also what the existing Faq.tsx does, and the
        only thing the two share.
     2. THE LIST IS WIDER THAN THE HEADING — 761 against 672, both centred. The
        header is deliberately the narrower column, so the questions start and
        end outside the heading above them. Reversing that (a wide head over a
        narrow list) is the more common arrangement and reads completely
        differently: this one puts the emphasis on the list.
     3. THE KICKER HAS NO BAR. WhyUsV4 and TestimonialsV4 both open with a
        20 × 2 gradient rule beside the label; this reference drops it and
        centres the bare mono line. With the label centred there is no left edge
        for a bar to start from, and one centred under a centred heading would
        read as a third element rather than as a mark on the first.
     4. THE KICKER GAP IS 10, NOT 16. The tightest gap in the whole set, and it
        is what binds the two lines into one header block rather than leaving
        the kicker floating above it.
     5. THE MARKER IS TYPOGRAPHIC. A 28px squircle holding a real "+" set in the
        display face at 18px bold, rather than V2's and V3's two drawn bars. It
        is heavier and less exact than a drawn glyph, which is the point in a
        section whose headings are extrabold.
     6. IT IS THE SHALLOWEST BAND OF THE FOUR — 64 top and bottom, against V2's
        and V3's 96 and TestimonialsV4's 144.

   NO LONGER NATIVE <details>, AND THE ANIMATION IS THE WHOLE REASON. A
   <details> cannot transition its own open state without ::details-content,
   which every other Faq variant in this repo also judged too new to lean on —
   so an answer arrived as a jump cut, the rules under it snapping to new
   positions with nothing for the eye to follow. This is the accordion contract
   written out by hand instead, exactly as components/v5/Faq.tsx and
   components/v7/Faq.tsx write it: a <button> carrying aria-expanded and
   aria-controls, a panel carrying role="region" and aria-labelledby. The same
   semantics, minus the free behaviour — which is why the three pieces below
   have to be got right.

     THE HEIGHT IS ANIMATED AS grid-template-rows, 0fr → 1fr, NOT as height.
     `height: auto` is not an interpolable value, and a measured pixel height
     would have to be re-measured on every resize and every font swap. A grid
     of one row with an `overflow-hidden` child hands the browser both ends of
     the transition without anyone measuring anything.

     THE ANSWER FADES AND RISES ON TOP OF THAT, and it is the half that makes
     this read as OPENING rather than as growing: the box starts moving at 0ms
     and the copy joins it at 90ms, so the text appears to come up out of a gap
     that already exists. Closing runs with no delay — a reader who has decided
     to close a row should not have to watch it argue.

     inert IS DOING REAL WORK. A panel collapsed to 0fr is invisible but still
     in the accessibility tree, so a screen reader would read all eight answers
     straight through and none of the questions would mean anything. `hidden`
     would fix that and kill the animation with it. `inert` takes the subtree
     out of the tree and out of the tab order while leaving it laid out, which
     is exactly the state a collapsed panel is in.

   ROWS OPEN INDEPENDENTLY, as they did when this was a <details> list: opening
   one does not close another. One-at-a-time is a one-line change
   (`setOpen(isOpen ? [] : [i])`) and a different section — it keeps the band
   short, at the cost of taking away an answer the reader never asked to lose.

   THE HEADING KEEPS ITS MARKED RUN. The reference sets its heading in one tone;
   this copy carries *asterisks* around its closing clause, and RevealText draws
   a gradient from them. Stripping the mark would mean rewriting the string in
   lib/content.ts, which the existing Faq.tsx and the other two variants also
   render — so the mark stays and only the size, weight and alignment come from
   the reference.

   Every duration here is inside globals.css's prefers-reduced-motion block,
   which flattens transition-duration site-wide — so the reduced-motion path is
   an instant open, not a broken one.

   The clamps run DOWNWARD only. Each lands on its desktop number by ~1280 and
   holds it above; the ramp exists for everything narrower. */

   which is what closes the list at both ends.

   THE TOP RULE IS SET FROM THE INDEX, NOT FROM `first:`. Every row here is the
   only child of its own Reveal wrapper, so `first-child` is true for all eight
   of them and a `first:border-t` would draw a rule above every row on top of
   the one already under the row before it. The variant has to come from the

   at 1px the difference is a single pixel of layout, and a border is what every
   other bounded thing on this page uses.

   `group-data-[open]:` stands in for the `group-open:` these classes carried

   what keep it optically centred through the turn.
