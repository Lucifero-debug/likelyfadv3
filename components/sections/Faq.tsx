/* Head on the left, list on the right, the head sticking as the list scrolls
   past it. Below the tablet breakpoint it collapses to one column and the head
   goes static — a sticky element in a single-column layout just eats the top of
   the screen.

   Native <details>, so the accordion needs no state, no JS and no client
   boundary — and it still opens if a script fails. The only work is hiding the
   two default markers (Safari ships its own ::-webkit-details-marker) and
   drawing our own, which rotates off `group-open`. */

            columns are `items-start`, so their boxes already begin at the same
            y — but the left column starts with TEXT, whose ink sits about that
            far below its own line box (half-leading, plus the gap between the
            ascender line and the cap), while this column starts with a
            hairline, which has no such inset. Without it the rule reads as
            sitting above the kicker rather than level with it. Taste knob: set
