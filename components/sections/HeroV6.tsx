/* ============================================================================
   THE SPLIT HERO — the homepage hero's copy, beside the drifting reel wall.

   THE COPY COLUMN IS components/sections/Hero.tsx, PORTED VERBATIM. Every
   typographic decision below — the kicker's leading rule, the 20ch/22ch
   headline cap, the four different top margins, the optical indent, the
   staggered entrance, the gradient run inside the headline — is that file's,
   and the reasoning for each is documented there rather than repeated here. If
   the two ever disagree, Hero.tsx is the one that is right.

   WHAT IS NOT PORTED IS THE FRAME. Hero.tsx is written to sit inside the SPLIT
   wrapper in app/page.tsx, which owns the grid, the page cap, the horizontal
   padding and the clearance under the fixed nav — which is why HERO there
   zeroes its own padding at `lap:`. This component owns all of that itself, so
   the section and grid below are its own and the copy column starts at the
   flex column Hero.tsx wraps its children in.

   THE GRADIENT IS BACK, and it is the one thing here that was a deliberate
   decision the other way. The earlier version of this file stripped the
   asterisks out of the headline and painted the CTA flat magenta, on the
   argument that a pink-to-purple ramp is the most recognisable AI-generated
   design tell in circulation and a strange thing to wear on a page whose pitch
   is that its output does not read as AI. Matching Hero.tsx means RevealText
   gets the asterisks and the CTA goes back to variant="grad". Worth knowing
   which decision was traded away, not worth re-litigating.

   THE WALL IS A FIXED-HEIGHT, overflow:hidden BOX. Its height is set here
   rather than derived from the clips inside it, so no amount of travel, no
   aspect ratio and no number of clips can make it grow or push the page around
   — which is what makes ReelWallV6's endless lanes survivable in a layout.
   It is also the crop for the 3D stage, whose overhang is measured against it.
   ========================================================================== */

   be clearly smaller than the space between the copy and the wall, which is the
   real division on the page.

   THE `lap:` END RAMPS WITH THE STAGE, on the same 1920-inert pattern as
   STAGE below: 3.333vw is exactly 64 at a 1920 viewport, so nothing moves at or
   under it, and it opens to 80 — the next rung up — as the stage widens. The
   ratio against the wall column gap is what actually has to survive the change,
   and 80:16 is the same 5:1 reading as 64:16. A fixed 64 beside a stage 400px

/* THE WALL'S FOOTPRINT — AND IT STARTS AT `tab`, NOT AT EVERY WIDTH.

   From `tab` up the wall is four vertical columns and the height is the crop:
   it is the `containerHeight` in ReelWallV6's seamlessness invariant, and what
   stops the endless lanes pushing the page around.

   BELOW `tab` THE WALL IS THREE HORIZONTAL ROWS AND ITS HEIGHT IS THE CONTENT'S.
   Pinning it there would be actively wrong: the rows are stacked, so a 400px box
   gives each row 123px, which back-solves through 9:16 to a 69px-wide clip —
   footage too small to read on the one device where the wall IS the page. Left
   to the content, each clip takes clamp(88,22vw,168) and the three rows come to
   roughly 500px on a phone. The crop that matters at that width is horizontal,
   and it is the wall's own width, which needs no declaring.

   FROM `lap:` THE WALL TAKES THE WHOLE LEFTOVER HEIGHT, AND THAT IS WHAT
   CLOSED THE GAP AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE SECTION.

   It used to be a FRACTION of the viewport — min(72svh, 680px) — inside a
   section that is min-h:100svh and centres its row. Those two do not agree on
   tall screens, and the disagreement is pure dead paper: at 2560x1440 the
   available box is 1440 - 96 - 64 = 1280, the wall and its caption came to 716,
   and the 564px left over was split by `items-center` into 282px of nothing
   above the hero and 282px below — ON TOP of the 96/64 the section already
   declares. The px ceiling made it worse the taller the display got, because it
   stopped scaling at a 944px window while the section never stops.

   Subtracting instead of scaling makes the two agree by construction. The three
   terms are the section's own box, written out rather than folded into one
   number so each stays traceable to the thing it pays for:

     96px — the section's pt, the fixed nav's clearance (91px tall at rest,
            and transparent until scrolled, so this one cannot come down)
     48px — the section's pb
     48px — the caption row under the wall: its 16 top margin plus one line of
            TEXT_META at the body's 1.6 leading, which is ~38 at the 0.85rem
            ceiling. Rounded UP to the next rung on purpose. Subtracting the
            measured 38 leaves the column 2px TALLER than the box it is being
            fitted into, and a hero that overshoots 100svh by two pixels is a
            scrollbar on a page that should not have one. 10px of slack costs
            5px of centring at each end and cannot round the wrong way.

   SO THE ONLY VERTICAL SPACE LEFT IS THE PADDING THE SECTION DECLARES. The row
   now measures exactly the available height, `items-center` has nothing to
   distribute, and the hero fills any display instead of floating in the middle
   of one. IF EITHER PADDING MOVES, THIS MOVES WITH IT — they are one
   measurement in two places, the same deal STAGE has with WRAP.

   888px IS THE SECTION'S OWN CEILING, RESTATED. The section stops at 1080
   (see the note on it), and 888 is what is left of 1080 after the same three
   terms — so the wall stops growing at exactly the height the band stops
   growing at, and neither one ends up with slack the other has to absorb. The
   two numbers move together or not at all.

   55vw WAS THE SEAMLESSNESS INVARIANT AND IS NOW SLACK, WHICH IS WORTH SAYING
   PLAINLY RATHER THAN LEAVING THE OLD CLAIM STANDING. ReelWallV6 needs
   `(sets - 1) x oneSetHeight >= containerHeight` or the loop visibly hitches
   once a cycle, and a set is four clips tall — so it scales with the wall's
   WIDTH while the two terms above scale with its HEIGHT. A narrow window on a
   tall monitor is where those come apart, which is why the cap is keyed to
   width at all.

   TWO CORRECTIONS TO WHAT THIS NOTE USED TO SAY, both found by measuring the
   running page rather than by arithmetic. First, the container the set is
   checked against is NOT this height: the wall's cells are `-inset-y-[20%]`, so
   the box a lane is clipped by is 1.4x it — 529 becomes 740, 888 becomes 1243.
   Every margin quoted here before was flattering by that factor. Second, the
   clips are the work wall's size now (see the note on the clamp in ReelWallV6),
   so a set caps at 1172 rather than 1367, and at 1920 and up that pair — 1172
   against 1243 — was the wrong way round. It is COLUMN_SETS at 3, not this cap,
   that carries the invariant today.

   MEASURED AT TWELVE VIEWPORTS AFTER THAT CHANGE, `(sets-1) x set` vs container:
   961x900 1742/740, 961x1440 1742/740, 1200 2144/924, 1440 2344/991, 1920 2344/
   1243, 2560 2344/1243. The tightest is 89% of margin, where it used to be a few
   per cent, so this cap is no longer what is holding the loop together — it is a
   design ceiling again, and the 55vw is what keeps a wide short window from
   giving the wall more height than the hero copy beside it.

   THERE USED TO BE A FOURTH TERM, 1400px, guarding the case 55vw cannot: STAGE
   stops at 1920, so past a ~2425 viewport the set stops growing at ~1776 while
   55vw keeps reading the whole display, and on a 3440x2160 panel that pair
   alone would have asked for 1892. The 888 is far below that and binds first at
   every size, so the term is gone rather than kept as decoration. It comes back
   if the section ceiling is ever raised past ~1590.

   `debug` prints the two numbers it is actually checking. */
const WALL_HEIGHT =
  "tab:h-[clamp(320px,48svh,448px)] lap:h-[min(100svh_-_96px_-_48px_-_48px,888px,55vw)]";

/* CORNER TO CORNER BELOW `tab`, AND ONLY THERE.

   The wall sits inside STAGE, which pads `clamp(24px,5vw,64px)` a side, and on
   a phone that padding is the whole difference between a wall and a strip: the
   rows run off both edges of the screen or they sit in a frame that announces
   how far they DON'T run. This cancels the padding for the wall alone — the
   caption below it stays in the column with the copy, which is where a line of
   type belongs.

   THE EXPRESSION MUST BE STAGE'S, CHARACTER FOR CHARACTER. It is one
   measurement in two places, the same deal WALL_HEIGHT has with the section's
   96 and 48: a negative margin that does not exactly cancel the padding either
   leaves a sliver of paper at each edge or pushes the wall past the viewport
   and gives the page a horizontal scrollbar. Change STAGE and change this.

   IT IS NOT A FREE 48px, AND THE COPY COUNT PAYS FOR IT NOW. Below `tab` the
   lanes run sideways and ReelWallV6's invariant is
   `(sets - 1) x oneSetWidth >= the wall's own width` — so widening the wall to
   the full viewport tightened the very margin that keeps the loop seamless.
   Four clips at the work wall's row size come to ~620px, which stops outrunning
   a full-bleed viewport at ~615px wide; the band from there to `tab` is inside
   the range this layout covers, and it is one of the two bands that took
   COLUMN_SETS from 2 to 3. Measured at 760, the worst width in the band, a lane
   now carries 1240 against a 760 container.

   SO THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS HAS CHANGED. It used to be the clip clamp that
   absorbed a wider bleed; the clamp is the work wall's now and is not free to
   move, so widening the bleed further spends copies instead — four more <video>
   per lane. Check the numbers in ReelWallV6's COLUMN_SETS note before doing it.

   `mx` RATHER THAN A NEGATIVE INSET OR A width: 100vw. The wall is a block in a
   grid cell, so symmetric negative margins let it resolve its own width against
   a box 48px wider than the cell — no positioning, no stacking context, and
   nothing that has to know how wide the viewport is. 100vw would also count the
   scrollbar, which is how full-bleed usually earns its horizontal scroll. */
const WALL_BLEED = "-mx-[clamp(24px,5vw,64px)] tab:mx-0";

      id="top"
      /* 100svh minus the fixed nav. min-h rather than h, so a short window
         scrolls the copy instead of clipping it.

         AND IT STOPS AT 1080. A band that tracks 100svh forever does not make a
         tall display look full, it makes the COPY look lost: the wall grows
         with the viewport, the copy does not, and `items-center` turns the
         difference into empty paper above and below the headline. At 2560x1440
         that was 336px at each end — more than four times the section padding,
         and the thing that actually read as "too much gap".

         1080 is the height of a full-HD screen, so nothing at or below 1080svh
         moves at all; it only binds on displays taller than that, which are
         exactly the ones where the drift showed. The hero then ends around 80%
         of a 1440 viewport, which also puts the top of Why-us on screen and
         gives the fold something to point at.

         RAISE THIS NUMBER TO MAKE THE HERO TALLER AGAIN — it and the 888 in
         WALL_HEIGHT are one measurement (888 = 1080 - 96 - 48 - 48).

         THE 96 AND THE 48 ARE READ BY WALL_HEIGHT, which subtracts both from
         100svh so the wall fills whatever this section leaves and the row does
         not float in the middle of a tall display. Change either number here
         and change it there — the note above WALL_HEIGHT has the arithmetic.

         THE BOTTOM CAME DOWN A RUNG, 64 TO 48, AND THE TOP CANNOT FOLLOW IT.
         The 96 is not taste, it is the fixed nav's clearance, and the nav is
         91px tall at rest and TRANSPARENT until it scrolls — so 96 already
         leaves only ~10px between the nav's ink and the top of the wall. One
         rung down and the first row of clips runs underneath live nav links on
         a bare paper ground, with nothing behind them to separate the two. The
         top of this section is spent, and the seam under it is where the air
         actually was.

         THE THIRD TERM AT `lap:` IS WALL_HEIGHT'S 55vw CAP, RUN BACKWARDS, and
         it is what stops the row floating on a NARROW-BUT-TALL viewport. The
         ceiling above answers to the viewport; the wall answers to 55vw as
         well, and between `lap:` (961px) and ~1400px those two stop agreeing:
         the wall shrinks with the width while the band still claims its 1080,
         and `items-center` splits the difference into paper above and below.
         Measured, that was 264px above and 216px below on an iPad Pro held
         portrait (1024x1366) and 276/228 in Chrome's desktop-site mode
         (980x2125) — against the 101/53 the same page gets at 1920 and above.

         55vw + 96 + 48 + 48 is WALL_HEIGHT's `100svh - 96 - 48 - 48` solved for
         the height that clause wants, so the band asks for exactly what the
         wall, its caption and the two paddings need and nothing beyond it. It
         is INERT WHERE THE WALL IS NOT 55vw-BOUND: past ~1600px wide the 1080
         is the smaller term and every desktop width is untouched. The residual
         slack is ~10px at every width now, which is what 1920 always had.

         IT IS THE SAME MEASUREMENT AS WALL_HEIGHT, WRITTEN BACKWARDS — the two
         96/48/48 triples move together or the air comes back. Scoped to `lap:`
         because the 55vw cap is: below it the wall is `clamp(320px,48svh,448px)`
         and the copy stacks over it, so the content already outgrows any floor
         this would set and the base rule is the one that reads. */

              there, then come in by half the plane. Everything in that sentence
              is a length the wall already declares.

                HALF THE PLANE IS `1.9 * (clip + its two paddings)`. The plane
                is four of those columns, so half is two — and the -22 degree
                turn foreshortens what it renders to about 0.95 of its flat
                width, which is where 1.9 comes from rather than 2.

                THE GAP AT THE EDGE IS 20px. The turn magnifies the near side
                past the stage's own 4.5% inset, so the rendered plane stops a
                little short of where the flat one would: measured 18px at 1024,
                15 at 1280, 14 at 1440, 11 at 1920.

              `50%` IS HALF THE CAPTION, WHICH IS THE COLUMN. The caption is a
              block, so a percentage in its own translate is a percentage of the
              column — the same quantity the frame's right edge is measured
              from. Subtracting the two lengths above from it lands the caption's
              centre on the clips'. It is a transform, so it moves nothing else
              and costs no layout, and it needs no width or margin of its own —
              which matters below 1440, where the plane is WIDER than its frame
              and any margin-based anchoring silently overflows instead.

              THE THREE NUMBERS ARE THE WALL'S OWN, and they are literals here
              for the reason every number in this pair is: Tailwind scans source
              TEXT and never sees a class built at runtime, so ReelWallV6's
              `clamp(116px,12vw,158px)` clip and its `clamp(4px,0.6vw,6px)`
              column padding are written out again rather than imported. IF
              EITHER MOVES THERE, IT MOVES HERE.

              Residual between the caption's centre and the clips', measured on
              the running page: 768 +1, 900 0, 1024 -2, 1280 -3, 1440 0,
              1920 0, 2560 +5. Inside five pixels across the range.

              `tab:` 761-960 GETS NOTHING. There the hero is stacked, the wall
              is a full-bleed band and the plane is centred in it, so the
              column's centre IS the wall's — and the projection's own 20px walk
              is corrected at the source, on the stage itself, rather than
              chased here. It used to get `-translate-x-[5%]`, which was the
              split layout's correction applied where there is no split: a 40px
              error in the wrong direction.

              `tab:` 761-960 GETS NOTHING, AND USED TO GET THE 5% BACKWARDS.
              There the hero is stacked and the wall is a full-bleed band with
              the plane centred in it, so the column's centre IS the wall's and
              any correction is an error rather than a fix. */}
