/* THE WORK — the volume wall.

   Three full-bleed rows of clips gliding THE SAME WAY. Sheer count is the
   argument, which is why this is a wall and not a curated grid — you are meant
   to lose track of how many there are.

   Dark on purpose. It is the one band between two light sections, so the work
   reads as the exhibit rather than as more page. Everything inside therefore
   takes the BRIGHT cut of the ramp and the muted light ink; the paper-safe
   pink lands around 3.6:1 on near-black, under the bar for type this small.

   THIS WALL IS THE EXPENSIVE ONE. It carries three times the clips the hero
   wall does, so every rule the hero wall's comments lay out is load-bearing
   here rather than merely tidy: no mask over a moving layer, no box-shadow in
   a transition, and `contain` on every row. See the note at each.

   EVERY TILE IS GATED ON VISIBILITY, through the same machinery as the rest of
   the page. Each one is a LazyVideo on a lane of its own row — `work-row-0/1/2`
   — so lib/useInViewPlay observes it, withholds its source until it is within
   200px of the viewport, plays at most PER_LANE per row, staggers the starts
   and stops everything for the length of a scroll gesture. The full argument
   for each of those numbers is in that file; the note above Tile says how this
   wall in particular sits on them.

   IT WAS NOT ALWAYS SO, AND THE HISTORY IS THE REASON THE COMMENTS HERE ARE AS
   LOUD AS THEY ARE. This wall used to opt out of all of it: 96 <video>
   elements with `autoPlay` and preload="auto", one play() on mount, nothing
   watching. Measured on a 1920x1080 load with nothing scrolled, that was 96
   simultaneous decoders — each uploading a fresh 288x512 texture to the GPU
   thirty times a second and compositing as its own layer — and 60 distinct
   clips, 18MB of video, fetched before the visitor had moved. The decoders did
   not stop when you left the section, because nothing was watching, so it was
   felt as a page that scrolled badly everywhere rather than only here.

   content-visibility: auto ON THE SECTION NEVER COVERED THAT, and it is worth
   knowing why, because it looks like it should. It skips layout, paint and
   compositing for the whole subtree while it is off screen — so the tiles were
   decoding without being drawn — but it does nothing whatever about network or
   decode. It is still here and still worth having; it was simply never the
   thing standing between this wall and its cost. The marquees being paused
   until the section is near is the same kind of saving, and the same
   limitation: neither touches playback. */

const ROWS = 3;
/* Each row renders its clips TWICE and slides by exactly half its own length,
   so ONE copy has to be wider than the viewport or the wrap point comes into
   frame. Sixteen tiles at a ~170px pitch is ~2720px, which covers a 2560
   monitor. Do not cut this to trim DOM nodes without redoing that sum.

   IT IS THE CEILING NOW RATHER THAN THE COUNT, and only on machines that report
   themselves weak — see useLeanRowLength in lib/useLeanWall.ts, which redoes
   exactly that sum against the actual viewport instead of against a 2560
   monitor nobody on a phone is holding. This number is still what every other
   visitor gets, and still what the server renders for all of them. */
const PER_ROW = 16;
/* Starts past everything the hero wall shows (4 lanes x 4), so the two walls
   do not open on the same clips. It cannot keep them fully apart any more: the
   deal below uses the WHOLE library to keep the three rows disjoint, and 39
   clips cannot also cover the hero wall's 16 without overlapping. The rows are
   the place a repeat reads as a repeat — the two walls are a page apart. */
const OFFSET = 18;

/* ONE DIRECTION FOR ALL THREE ROWS, AND THE DURATIONS ARE WHAT KEEPS THEM
   FROM READING AS ONE BLOCK. The middle row used to carry
   `animation-direction: reverse` so the wall ran right · left · right.
   Counter-running rows are the classic marquee move and they cost this wall
   the thing it is for: two tiles a few pixels apart travelling opposite ways
   put a shear line between them, and the eye stops counting clips and starts
   tracking the seam. A wall you are meant to lose count in cannot hand you
   three separate things to follow.

   NOTHING REPLACES REVERSE, because the desynchrony was never its job. 88, 104
   and 94 seconds share no common multiple worth reaching, so the rows drift
   against each other continuously and no two tiles stay neighbours — which is
   the whole of what the alternation was really providing, minus the shear.

   THESE ARE THE SECONDS A FULL 16-TILE SET TAKES, NOT THE SECONDS ANY PARTICULAR
   PHONE RUNS. laneSeconds below scales them, and that scaling is the whole of
   what stops the wall crawling on a phone. */
const ROW_STYLE = [{ seconds: 88 }, { seconds: 104 }, { seconds: 94 }];

/* WHY THE DURATION HAS TO FOLLOW THE TILE COUNT.

   A lane slides by exactly half its own length, so its SPEED is (length / 2)
   over the duration — a distance that is not a constant. useLeanRowLength trims
   a set to what the viewport can actually show, which is 16 tiles on a desktop
   and about 9 on a 390px phone; against a fixed 88s those 9 tiles crawl past at
   a little over half the pixels per second the desktop gets. The wall read as
   nearly still on a phone for exactly that reason: not a slow animation, a
   short lane given a long lane's clock.

   SO THE CLOCK IS CUT IN THE SAME PROPORTION AS THE LANE. perRow / PER_ROW is
   the fraction of the set this machine kept, and the duration keeps that same
   fraction — which holds the lane at ONE TILE PER FIXED INTERVAL at every
   width. Tile-widths per second, not pixels per second, is the right invariant
   here: the phone's tiles are narrower too (~129px against ~158px), and a
   marquee is read against the things moving in it rather than against the
   screen behind them. Matching pixels instead would leave the phone reading
   slow all over again, by the width of a tile.

   THE RATIOS SURVIVE IT because all three rows are scaled by the same fraction,
   so 88 : 104 : 94 is intact and the rows go on drifting apart as above.

   IT IS A NO-OP ON ANYTHING THAT KEPT ITS FULL SET — desktops, tablets, and the
   server, whose perRow IS PER_ROW. Hydration therefore matches, and the phone
   picks up its shorter clock in the same client pass that slices its lane. */
const laneSeconds = (full: number, perRow: number) =>
  Math.round(full * (perRow / PER_ROW) * 10) / 10;

/* NO CLIP EVER CROSSES BETWEEN ROWS, AND THAT IS NOW STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN
   LUCKY. The rows want ROWS x PER_ROW = 48 tiles and the library holds 39, so
   something has to repeat. This used to ask takeReels for all 48 and let the
   modulo at the end of it wrap the window. That happened to keep the rows
   disjoint — a wrapped pair sits `library.length` apart in the deal, and 39 is
   divisible by ROWS, so both halves landed in the SAME row — but only while
   the folder holds a multiple of three. One clip added or removed in Drive and
   the same clip shows up in two rows at once, which is the one repeat nobody
   can miss: three rows side by side get compared against each other, not
   against the tile that passed eight seconds ago.

   So the library is dealt out ONCE, column-major, into three disjoint sets:
   clip i of the spread order goes to row i % ROWS, every clip is dealt exactly
   once, and no row can be handed a clip another row already has — at any
   library size. Column-major also keeps the spread working, since tiles
   adjacent in a row are ROWS apart in takeReels' order, which is what stops
   two clips from one shoot landing next to each other.

   THE SHORTFALL IS THEN A ROW'S OWN BUSINESS, and that is the visible half of
   this change. 39 clips over three rows is 13 each against a row of 16, so
   each row repeats three of its OWN clips. The wrapped window put those three
   thirteen tiles apart in a sixteen-tile cycle — three apart the short way
   round, i.e. very nearly neighbours. Placing them half a cycle from the
   original (PER_ROW / 2 = 8) is the furthest apart the loop allows. The row
   renders its list twice, so every tile already has a twin 16 away regardless;
   this only stops the extra three from sitting on top of theirs.

   Hoisted out of the component because it is pure over module constants. It
   used to run per render, so the whole union-find-and-sort in reelOrder re-ran
   on every pause toggle and every lightbox open and close. */
const LIBRARY = content.reels.videos;

/* Tiles are smaller and squarer-cornered than the hero wall's cards: this wall
   is about count, and a smaller tile puts more of them on screen.

   THE POSTER IS AN <img>, NOT A BACKGROUND. It was a background-image, which
   paints early and needs no element — but a CSS background cannot be lazy
   loaded, so all ninety-six fetched and decoded the moment the section came
   into view: ~2.4MB over the wire and ~28MB of decoded bitmap, in one burst,
   during the scroll that brought them there. A real <img loading="lazy"> lets
   the browser defer everything off screen, so entering the section pays for
   roughly the dozen tiles per row actually visible and the rest arrive as they
   translate in. `bg-[#1a1620]` below is what shows until one lands.

   It is also the only copy of the poster, deliberately: setting it as the
   video's `poster` attribute as well made the browser hold two decoded rasters
   of the same webp per tile.

   OPACITY AND TRANSFORM ONLY. box-shadow used to be named in this transition
   too, driving a 54px-blur hover shadow, and it is the one property that can
   never be: it repaints that blur every frame, around a tile the marquee is
   translating and a video is decoding into. The bigger hover shadow is now a
   second layer cross-faded over the resting one (the ::after), which
   composites instead of repainting. Transform is safe for the opposite reason
   — the hover scale is a compositor operation on one tile at a time, and it
   costs nothing per frame while the tile sits at rest.

   The scale is 1.05 and NOT MORE, because the room for it is finite: see the
   padding on the row below, which is what stops it being clipped.

   Keep utility syntax OUT of these comments, incidentally — Tailwind scans the
   whole file, comments included, and will emit a real class for anything that
   parses as one.

   `overflow-hidden` moved off the tile and onto the span around the video, so
   the ::after is free to paint its shadow OUTSIDE the tile. The background
   image needs no clip of its own — a background is already clipped to the
   border box, radius included. */

   layer beneath it — here a ~2720px-wide row holding thirty-two decoding
   videos — through an extra compositing pass on every single frame, while a
   gradient over a known solid background is a flat paint and looks identical.
   The stop colour IS the section's outer colour (#17141b), which is what the
   radial has settled to by the time it reaches these edges, and the far end
   names the same channels at alpha 0: fading to bare `transparent` would ramp
   through rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) and darken the middle of the fade.

   THE WIDTH IS SIZED TO A TILE, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS 12% AND NOT 7%. This is
   the second half of the playback budget in lib/useInViewPlay: PER_LANE tops
   out at 11 while 11-12 tiles per row clear THRESHOLD, so on the wide end of
   that range ONE tile per row is always held on its poster. The FIFO queue
   parks it at the edge the lane feeds in from — the right edge for all three
   rows now that all three run the same way — so a fade wide enough to cover a
   tile there is what turns a frozen frame into an edge that is simply dark.
   Both fades stay: the wall is full bleed, and the left one is still covering
   the edge each row is travelling OUT of.

   7% was 133px against a ~170px tile pitch: never wide enough to cover one,
   so the held tile sat measurably outside it, ~200px in, at full
   intersectionRatio. 12% is 228px at a 1902px section, which reaches it. The

/* THIS WALL IS BACK ON THE SHARED PLAYBACK REGISTRY.

   IT USED TO PLAY EVERY TILE, FOREVER, AND NOT ASK WHERE IT WAS — one ref, one
   play() on mount, no observer, `autoPlay` and preload="auto". That policy was
   deliberate and it was measured to be the single most expensive thing on the
   page: on a 1920x1080 load with nothing scrolled, all 96 tiles were playing
   and fully buffered while sitting below the fold, which was 60 distinct clips
   and 18MB of video before the visitor had moved. `content-visibility: auto` on
   the section skips layout, paint and compositing for the subtree but does
   nothing whatever about network or decode, so it never covered this.

   Every tile is a LazyVideo now, keyed to a lane per row. What that buys, and
   the reasoning behind each number, is in lib/useInViewPlay: the source is not
   attached until a tile is within 200px of the viewport, at most PER_LANE play
   at once per row, a dwell means tiles you scroll PAST never fetch at all, and
   starts are staggered so a row does not open sixteen streams into one pipe.

   WHAT IT COSTS, stated plainly because the old policy existed to avoid it: a
   tile entering the row holds its poster for the dwell before it starts, and
   the tiles bunched at the feeding edge wait for a slot. That is the same
   behaviour the hero wall has always had, and the FIFO ordering puts the held
   ones under the row's own edge fade. */

/* WHETHER THIS SECTION'S MARQUEES SHOULD BE RUNNING AT ALL.

   IT USED TO GATE THE TILES TOO, and that was the more important of its two
   jobs: useInViewPlay observes every tile on the page through one shared
   IntersectionObserver, and an observer recomputes EVERY target it holds on any
   frame where something moved. The hero wall's lanes move constantly, which
   forced this section's 96 tiles to be re-intersected sixty times a second,
   each one a rect walked up through transformed and clipped ancestors, while
   the section was far below the fold and could not be seen. Profiled on the
   production build: 29% renderer main thread, 273ms of a 5s trace inside
   computeIntersections, against 1.1% with the section removed.

   THE TILES ARE OBSERVED AGAIN. That problem has not been designed away, it
   has been RE-ACCEPTED: all 96 are LazyVideo tiles registered with the shared
   observer, which is the same population the trace above measured.

   WHAT IS DIFFERENT is that only one of the two observers holds them for good.
   LazyVideo's attach observer unobserves each tile permanently the first time
   it comes near — it has nothing left to ask once the source is on — so that
   half drains to nothing. The playback registry's half does not drain, and
   cannot: it has to keep watching to know when a tile leaves.

   `near` DOES NOT GATE THEM, AND COULD. useInViewPlay and LazyVideo both take
   an `enabled` flag for exactly this, and this wall passes neither, so its
   tiles register on mount and stay registered whether or not the section is
   anywhere near. If computeIntersections shows up in a trace again, threading
   `near` down to Tile as `enabled` is the one-line way back to what the
   paragraph above describes. It is off for now because the source attach gate
   sits in front of playback, so an unregistered tile cannot be the thing that
   fetches early — the flag would buy observer time and nothing else, and that
   is a trade worth making from a trace rather than from a guess.

   WHAT IS LEFT IS THE MARQUEE. Three lanes dragging a 32-clip
   will-change: transform track composite every frame whether or not anyone can
   see them, and `near` is what stops that while the section is away.

   content-visibility ON THE SECTION DOES NOT COVER IT, quite: it skips
   rendering for an off-screen subtree, which is most of the cost, but the
   animations remain live and the two together are cheaper than either alone. */

         32-clip `will-change: transform` track. The ANIMATIONS were not gated on
         anything: they composited every frame whether or not the section was on
         screen, which meant that sitting still on the hero, three tracks nobody
         could see were competing for frames with the hero wall's own lanes.

         IT MATTERS MORE SINCE THE CLIPS STOPPED BEING GATED. Those 96 elements
         are all playing all the time now — see the note at the head of the file
         — so this rule is no longer one saving among several. It is the only
         thing standing between an off-screen wall and the full cost of it, and
         it is why the tiles decode without also being laid out, painted and
         composited while nobody is looking at them.

         content-visibility: auto makes the browser skip layout, paint AND
         compositing for the whole subtree until it comes into view, so the cost
         is zero rather than merely small. Nothing changes once you reach it.

         contain-intrinsic-size IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. Without it the skipped
         section measures 0 tall, the page shrinks by its full height, and the
         scrollbar jumps every time it enters or leaves — which would trade one
         kind of jank for a worse one. 1200px is this section's real height at a
         desktop width (three 158px tiles at 9:16, plus gaps, heading and the
         SECTION clamp); the `auto` keyword means the browser replaces that
         estimate with the measured height the first time it renders, so the
         guess only has to be close once. */

          rows, so the effect costs two elements rather than one mask per row. */}

               so one clip can be read out of forty-eight without the rest going
               dark. `:not(:hover)` rather than dim-all-then-undim-one: two
               rules writing opacity at equal specificity would have their
               winner decided by emit order.

               `contain` scopes the marquee's per-frame layout and paint
               invalidation to the row rather than letting it walk the page.

               py-3 -my-3 IS WHAT GIVES THE HOVER SCALE SOMEWHERE TO GO. Both
               `overflow-hidden` and `contain: paint` clip at the padding box,
               and a row with no padding is exactly as tall as its tiles — so a
               tile growing 5% would have had its top and bottom sliced off. The
               12px of padding is the room, and the equal negative margin hands
               it straight back to the layout, so the visible gap between rows
               is still the container's own and nothing below moves. At the
               widest tile (158px, so 281px tall) a 1.05 scale needs 7px a side:
               inside 12, with margin to spare. Raise the scale and this has to
               rise with it.

               The rows' padding boxes now OVERLAP by that same 12px, which is
               why the hover needs a z-index as well: without it the next row
               paints over the part of the magnified tile that bleeds into the
               shared strip. Rows are flex items, so z-index applies to them
               with no positioning of their own. */

      {/* THE ONE CONTROL ON THIS BAND, AND IT IS THE END OF THE SCROLL RATHER
          THAN AN INTERRUPTION IN IT. The wall answers "is this real"; a visitor
          who is convinced by it has nowhere to go next except past the section,
          so the ask belongs under the evidence and after all three rows rather
          than beside the heading.

          `light`, NOT `grad`. The gradient is the page's primary action and it
          is spent twice already in the hero, and a second gradient pill on a
          dark band would read as the same button repeated rather than a
          different offer. A white pill on this ground is the only variant that
          is unmissable without competing: `dark` and `ghost` both paint ink on
          near-black and disappear.

          THE GAP MIRRORS HEAD_GAP, deliberately — clamp(32,4.5vw,64) above the
          CTA is the same air the heading block leaves below itself, so the wall
          sits in a band with matched margins instead of being top-heavy. Both
          ends are rungs on the scale in lib/ui.ts. It is spelled out rather
          than imported because HEAD_GAP is a `mb-` and Tailwind scans source
          TEXT, so a class built by swapping the prefix at runtime is never
          generated — the same reason the perspective and the lane speeds are
          literals.

          `items-center` in a column: the toggle, if it ever comes back, stacks
          under the CTA rather than beside it. It used to sit alone at the right
          edge, which is the right place for a utility control and the wrong
          place for the section's ask. */}
